## simulator

This programs simulates the main board, allowing the display to properly boot/run
without using the real main board.

To use, build the program with `make`, then connect a USB/serial converter between
the computer and the display (make sure it shows as `/dev/ttyUSB0`), then run
`./simulator`. Press Ctrl+C to end the simulation, and make sure to start the
simulator before powering on the display.
